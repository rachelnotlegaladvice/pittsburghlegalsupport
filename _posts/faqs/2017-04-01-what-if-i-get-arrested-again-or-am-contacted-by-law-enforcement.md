title: What if I get arrested again? Or am contacted by law enforcement?
---
Notify your attorney **immediately** if you are arrested on other charges, receive a summons or other legal process in the mail, or are contacted in any way by law enforcement or the prosecution. Your attorney will **not** automatically receive notice of new charges filed against you.

It also extremely important to let your attorney if you are contacted by law enforcement or the prosecution about your current charges or new charges. You should not answer any of their questions unless your attorney is present (and, even then, you are not ***required*** to answer).
