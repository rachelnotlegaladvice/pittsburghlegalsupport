title: Am I allowed to record law enforcement?
---
* It is **legal** to record law enforcement performing their official duties in public in all fifty states. 
	* However, you may not obstruct or interfere with the performance of their duties or ignore orders to disperse. 
* Absent a valid search warrant, you are **not** required to hand over your camera or to show officers your footage. You are also **never** obligated to answer questions about what or why youâ€™re recording.
* If you have footage of police brutality, the safest thing to do with such footage is to make the victim and their attorney (if any) aware of it. 
	* **Never** document anything that could **even remotely** be construed by a prosecutor, jury, or the public as resisting arrest or assault on an officer.
	* Immediately uploading footage to the Internet can have **unintended negative repercussions**, such as being used as evidence **against** the victim of police brutality.
