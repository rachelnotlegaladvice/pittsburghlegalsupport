title: When am I required to show my ID?
---
* In Pennsylvania, you are also not required to identify yourself to law enforcement.
* Exceptions:
	* If you are operating a vehicle, you are required to provide your driver's license. This does ***not*** apply to passengers. 
    * If you are in a restricted area (such as private businesses, some college campuses, etc), you may be required to provide ID to prove your right to be there.
