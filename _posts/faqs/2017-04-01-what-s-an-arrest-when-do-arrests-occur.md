When law enforcement have **probable cause** (defined as "a reasonable belief that a person has committed a crime" or "a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious person's belief that certain facts are probably true") to believe that you have been involved in a crime, they may place you under arrest. While you are under arrest, you are in police custody, not free to leave, and have limited privacy rights.

An arrest does ***not*** mean that you are guilty of a crime. Determinations of guilt are up to judge or a jury (or most often, a negotiated plea argreement), not law enforcement.
