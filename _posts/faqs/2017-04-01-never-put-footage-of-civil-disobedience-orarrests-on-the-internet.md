CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IS ILLEGAL (that’s why it’s called “**dis**obedience”) and disorderly conduct and riot (often a felony charge) statutes are written to be extremely vague and can encompass a great deal of “regular” protest activity.

_"Thankfully, there are so many characters out there looking to post their exploits on YouTube. We’re greatly assisted by YouTube and social media, so in that regard I want to thank them for providing us with the evidence that will ultimately help us to arrest them and hopefully successfully prosecute them."_ - NYPD Police Commissioner Bratton
