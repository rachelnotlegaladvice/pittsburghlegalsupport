**Preliminary Arraignment**: If you’re in being held in custody, your preliminary arraignment will be held before a Magistrate District Judge within 72 hours of your arrest. At this stage, you will be officially notified of the charges against you and your bail, if any, will be set. If you received a summons, rather than having been arrested, your bail, if any, may be set before the Preliminary Hearing.

**Preliminary Hearing**: If you’re in being held custody, your preliminary hearing will take place 3-10 days after your arrest, though if your case proceeds by summons the time period may be longer. These hearings are held in open court either before a judge at the Pittsburgh Municipal Court Building (660 First Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219) or before a magistrate at a Magisterial District Judge’s Office (address will be on your criminal complaint). The purpose of a preliminary hearing is to determine whether the prosecutor has enough evidence to justify further criminal proceedings against the accused. The Commonwealth must present a prima facie case against you; in other words, the prosecution must show the Magistrate that they have met the basic elements of the crimes that they have charged you with. 

**Formal Arraignment**: Your formal arraignment will occur approximately 6-8 weeks after your preliminary hearing and will be held at the Allegheny County Courthouse (436 Grant Street, 5th Floor, Room 519, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15219). You will be formally presented with the charges against you as well as assigned a Judge and Pre-Trial Conference date. 

**Pre-Trial Conference**: The pre-trial conference occurs approximately 2-4 weeks after your formal arraignment and is held at the Allegheny County Courthouse. You will receive a trial date and the judge may rule on preliminary trial motions.

**Trial**: Your criminal trial may last several days and will proceed as a jury trial or non-jury/bench trial. You may also be offered a plea agreement.

**Sentencing**: You may be sentenced the same day as your trial or plea or up to ninety (90) days later. 

**Appeals/Post Conviction Relief**: Appeals must be filed within 30 days of your sentencing date or court’s rulings on Post Sentence Proceedings. The Appellate Courts will only consider issues that allege errors of law, not fact.
