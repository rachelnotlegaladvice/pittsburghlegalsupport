title: I was offered a plea. What now?

Make sure that you are **100% clear** on what you are agreeing to before signing or verbally agreeing to anything. Be aware of **everything** you're conceding as well as any **future negative repercussions** that the plea may carry. If you are not represented by an attorney, consider retaining one to go over your options with you.
