title: What if I'm not a citizen and/or undocumented?
---
It is **extremely important** that you do not answer any questions about your immigration status, enter into a plea agreement, or sign **anything** without speaking to an experienced immigration attorney first. 

A conviction for a “crime involving moral turpitude” (_which is undefined_) can land a non-citizen in removal proceedings, or jeopardize their chances of receiving a green card or of obtaining citizenship. If you're on a student visa, a violation of your university’s code of conduct that leads to your explusion will also result in the revocation of your visa.
