title: One of the most important things to do post-arrest is to Shut. Your. Mouth.
---
Law enforcement may try to talk with you after you have been arrested often while promising to speak on your behalf in court or agree to reduce or withdraw your charges. These promises are often **unenforceable**. Once you are arrested, your fate is up to the judge, not your arresting officer or the prosecutor. 

It is also **dangerous*** and ***inadvisable** to talk to friends or family about your case or charges. Doing so puts **them at risk** of receiveing a subpoena to **testify against you**. Even innocent statements can be used to make you appear guilty, even if you are not.

**THIS INCLUDES POSTING ABOUT YOUR CASE OR CHARGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA.**
