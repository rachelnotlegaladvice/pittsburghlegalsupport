title: 'I was released on bond, what does that mean?'
---
Bond is designed to guarantee your attendence at all scheduled court dates and compliance with the terms of your release. 

If you fail to appear for a scheduled court appearance or break a condition of your release, the judge will issue a bench warrant for your arrest and may send a bondsman or a deputy sheriff out to arrest you. Once the warrant is issued, **any** contact you have with law enforcement could **result in your arrest**. 

All bail given to the court for your release will also be forfeited and you may be charged with additional crimes related to your failure to appear.

**Make sure the the courts and your attorney have your correct address and phone number.**
