If your propery was taken by your arresting officer prior to your being transported or processed, it is likely that your belongings are being held at your arresting officer's zone station. A list of Pittsburgh Police zone stations is available [here](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/police/zones). 

If your property was confiscated during processing, it will be returned to you upon release. If your property is not returned to you and is not being held at a zone police station, let your attorney know.

Family members can be authorized by inmates to pick up personal belonings from the front lobby of Allegheny County Jail between 1:45 and 2:00pm. Family members must call (412) 350-2267 between 8:00-10:00am on the date of pick-up.
