**Summary offenses** include trespass, disorderly conduct, and obstruction of highways or other public passageways. These charges can carry a maximum $300 fine or 90 days in jail and are usually handled by a magistrate and settled in one hearing.

**Misdemeanors** include more severe forms of trespass, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and obstruction of highways or other public passageways as well as failure of a disorderly person to disperse upon official order and obstructing administration of law or other government function. These charges can carry a maximum $10,000 fine or five years imprisonment and are handled in a criminal court involving multiple court appearances. Those without a prior arrest history that are charged with a non-violent misdemeanor may be eligible for participation in an Accelerated Rehabilitate Disposition (ARD) program in which charges are dropped in exchange for restitution, counseling, and/or probation. 

**Felonies** include assault on a officer and riot. These charges can carry a maximum $25,000 fine or 25 years in jail and are handled in criminal court, often involving several court appearances.

Those arrested at protests in Allegheny County are generally charged with a variety of the above-listed offenses which are typically pled down to a summary offense or dropped entirely in exchange for community service.
