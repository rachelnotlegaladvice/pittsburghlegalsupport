title: How do I post bail for someone?
---
At the preiminary arraignment, three types of bail may be set:
* non-monetary/personal bond,
* straight bail (full amount must be paid to secure release), or 
* bail bond ( ~10% of the bail amount must be paid to secure release)

Monetary bail is generally only required for those:
* with out of state addresses,
* charged with more serious crimes, such as assault, and/or
* with prior criminal records and/or active warrants.

If posted through [Allegheny County Bail Services](https://www.alleghenycourts.us/criminal/pretrial_services/bail_services/default.aspx) [phone: (412) 350- 4732] these amounts (minus filing & processing fees) are refunded at the conclusion of legal proceedings. 

Bail (paid in cash or money order) can be posted at the [Municipal District Court building](https://goo.gl/maps/xhNsbQMZ2Hm). Bail can also be posted online [here](https://ujsportal.pacourts.us/bail/Default.aspx). Credit cards are accepted up to $20,000 ($2.75 fee). 

Amounts paid to private bond agencies (typically 5-10% of the posted amount) are nonrefundable. Most private bail agencies require the person posting bail to provide photo identification as well as proof of mailing address. 

**If the arrestee fails to appear at any scheduled court appearancess any bail posted to secure their release will be forfeited and, in the case of a percentage bond, the person who posted bail is responsible for the full amount. **

_It may still take several hours after bond is posted for a person to be processed for release, especially if a mass arrest occured_. If bail is posted quickly (before the arrestee is transferred), the arrestee will be released from the [Municipal District Court building](https://goo.gl/maps/xhNsbQMZ2Hm). If bail posting takes longer (after the arrestee has been transferred), the arrestee will be released from  [Allegheny County Jail](https://goo.gl/maps/h1SfEPzyRaJ2).
