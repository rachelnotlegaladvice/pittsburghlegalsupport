title: What if law enforcement ask to search my belongings?
---
* You are **never** required to consent to a search.
	* Loudly & clearly state, "_I do not consent to any searches_" but do **not** attempt to phsyically resist or interfere with the officer's actions.
* However:
	* If law enforcement have probable cause to conduct the search, they do not need to ask your permission. 
    * If you are being detained, officers may conduct a brief over-the-clothing pat down (commonly known as a "frisk") that does **not** require you to empty your pockets or open your bags.
	* If you are under arrest, officers can search you all the way down to your skin as well as conduct an administrative inventory of your belongings.
