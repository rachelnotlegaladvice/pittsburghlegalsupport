title: Do they have to warn us before making an arrest?
---
It's unclear if a warning is required before making a mass arrest. However, it is standard for a disperal warning to be given three times before a mass arrest takes place. 

_Note: This only applies to mass arrests for unlawful assembly and may not apply in all other circumstances._
