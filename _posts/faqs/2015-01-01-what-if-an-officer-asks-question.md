* You are **never** obligated to answer any questions.
	* The ***only*** time you are ***ever*** required to answer questions about alleged criminal activity is if you receive a subpoena to testify. This requires you to answer a ***judge's*** (or in the case of a grand jury subpeona, a prosecutor's - more on grand juries under the "I received a grand jury subpoena" header) questions, not a law enforcement agent's.
