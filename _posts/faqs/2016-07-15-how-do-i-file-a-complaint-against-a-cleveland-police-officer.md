title: 'My rights were violated! How do I file a complaint? '
---

You can file an official complaint against any public safety official via the Offive of Municipal Investigation [here](http://pittsburghpa.gov/omi/complaint). Complaints against police officers must be filed within 90 days and should include their name and badge number.

You can file an official complaint against a member of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police via the Citizen Police Review Board [here](http://cprbpgh.org/about/filing-a-complaint/file-a-complaint-now).

****Be careful not to admit to any wrongdoing**** in your complaint. It can be extremely helpful to have the assistance of a lawyer while completing a complaint.

If you believe that your civil rights were violated, you may also retain a private attorney to file a 1983 complaint against the officer or the police department.
