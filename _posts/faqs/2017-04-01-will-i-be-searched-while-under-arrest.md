title: Will I be searched while under arrest?
---
Once under arrest, law enforcement may search your body down to your skin, your belongings, and your immediate surroundings. For this reason, if law enforcement come to your door and you believe that you may be placed under arrest, it is usually a good idea to **step outside** while **shutting and locking** the door behind you - _anything located in plain sight (or smell or earshot) does not require a warrant_. 

Regardless of the apparent lawfulness of the search, you should still **loudly and clearly** announce that you **do not consent** to any searches in case the search is later found to be unlawful as well as to guard against things outside the allowable scope of the search being used against you later in court.
