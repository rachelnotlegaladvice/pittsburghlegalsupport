title: I need an attorney!
---
If you cannot afford an attorney, you may qualify for a public defender. The [Allegheny County Public Defender's Office](http://www.alleghenycounty.us/opd) is located at [542 Forbes Ave, 4th Floor, 15219](https://goo.gl/maps/yf27Jwsf2FN2) (downtown) and can be reached at (412) 350-2400. To qualify you must be: (1) charged with an offense covered by PAâ€™s Public Defender Act; & (2) financially unable to hire a private attorney (requires 4 pay stubs or proof of government support).

The Allegheny County Bar Association provides a [Lawyer Referral Service](http://www.getapittsburghlawyer.com/) as well as [Find a Lawyer](http://www.pittsburghfindalawyer.org/).

The National Lawyers Guild also provides a [Referral Directory](https://www.nlg.org/referral-directory).
