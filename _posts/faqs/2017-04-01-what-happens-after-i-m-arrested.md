title: What happens after I'm arrested?

You will be handcuffed (with either metal regular cuffs or flexicuffs which resemble zip ties) and put into a vehicle (depending on the size of the arrest this may be a squad car, police van, bus, etc) with other arrestees. You may be sitting there for a while before being taken to the station or jail to be booked. **You are not required to answer any questions** during the booking process though failure to respond to questions regarding your identify (name, date of birth, and address) may significantly delay your release. You will also be fingerprinted and asked about any current medications and your medical history. You may also be asked to sign your citation which is the **only** thing that you should sign while in custody.

After going through intake, you will be housed in a holding cell with other arrestees (not necessarily other demonstrators) of your legal sex (do not assume that the police will honor your gender identity) awaiting your preliminary arraignment for several hours or up to three days (72 hours). Those arrested on Friday or Saturday nights often have longer processing times than those arrested other days and times. At your preliminary arraignment (which may be conducted via a closed circuit television system), you will be formally charged by a prosecutor, a determination as to bail will be made, and your preliminary hearing will be scheduled.
