title: What should I do if I am placed under arrest?
---
**Your goal is to avoid incriminating yourself or incriminating yourself further** - not to talk your way out of an arrest by agreeing to waive your rights or inadvertently waving your rights by allowing law enforcement to "just have a quick look around" or by "answering a few routine questions." 

**You cannot talk your way out of an arrest.**

**You have no obligation to speak to law enforcement and any information that you provide may be used against you during legal proceedings.** You should invoke you rights to remain silent and to speak to an attorney immediately. Invoking your rights after an arrest cannot be used against you in court as evidence of your guilt; however information gained from waiving your rights can, **and will always** be used **against** you.

 Contrary to popular belief, law enforcement are **not** required to read you these rights (commonly known as your Miranda warnings) unless they intend to question you while you are still in their custody.

Once these rights have been invoked, law enforcement are not permitted to question you about the crime for which you have been placed under arrest. Once you have invoked your right to remain silent and/or to speak to an attorney, you must then **remain completely silent**. If you begin to speak, you have waived those rights and must repeat them in order to reinvoke their protections. 

Be aware that any information gathered from small talk, making jokes, or answering "innocent" questions can be used against you in court. If law enforcement are speaking to you, they are doing so for a reason. Keep in mind that members of law enforcement are **allowed to deliberately mislead you or outright lie to you** in order to convince you that giving them information is in your best interest.
